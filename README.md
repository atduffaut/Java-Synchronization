# Java-Synchronization
Astronomers-Astrologists simulation demonstrating multithreading and synchronization in Java. Uses semaphores and mutexes to ensure no race conditions occur
between all the travelers that are trying to settle mars. A fun simulation exercise meant to improve skills in multithreading using Java.

Note: Still working on completing implementation of Quarantine, Earth, and Mars Location classes, they don't have any functionality yet.
